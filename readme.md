<h1>VulnerabilityFinder</h1>
<p>VulnerabilityFinder is a Kotlin library designed to empower developers by providing an interface to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). It allows you to fetch and analyze vulnerabilities related to specific products, which can be defined by vendor, type, and version.</p>
<p>This library is particularly useful for security analysts, developers, and organizations who want to ensure their software products are secure and up-to-date with the latest vulnerability information.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fetch all vulnerabilities related to a specific product from the NVD</li>
<li>
Option to retrieve only open vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>
Pagination support to handle the NVD API's limit on the number of vulnerabilities that can be retrieved in a single request.
</li>
<li>
Built with Kotlin and uses Gradle for dependency management.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To use this library, you need to include it in your project's dependencies. You can do this by adding the following to your <code>build.gradle</code> file:</p>

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.parsamlm:VulnerabilityFinder:1.0")
}
```

<p>Then, you can use the fetchAllVulnerabilities function to retrieve vulnerabilities. Here's an example:</p>

```kotlin
val vulnerabilities = VF.fetchAllVulnerabilities(
    apiKey = "your_api_key",
    findOnlyVulnerable = true,
    vendor = "vendor_name",
    type = "product_type",
    version = "product_version"
)
```

<p><b>Note:</b> Having an API key is optional (it can be 'null') but it is suggested to have one to increase requests limit. <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key">Request one from NVD website</a>.</p>
